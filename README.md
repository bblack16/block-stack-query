# BlockStack Query

BlockStack Query is a powerful library and meta language for querying database structures that presents a single expression language that can easily be translated into many popular formats via adapters. Queries can be expressed very programmitcally or using plain English for clarity and ease of use for non-developers. The example below should be all you need to know.

```ruby
# You can create a query using plain english and most standard operators.
# You can also group expressions using parenthesis to make complex queries.
query = BlockStack::Query.new('name is Steve AND age < 70 OR name starts with Jo')

# Now we can convert the query into adapter specific query strings
puts query.to_sqlite
# => (name == 'Steve' AND age < 70) OR name LIKE 'Jo%'
puts query.to_mongo
# => {"$or":[{"name":"Steve","age":{"$lt":70}},{"name":{"$regex":"(?-mix:^Jo)","$options":"i"}}]}
puts query.to_elasticsearch
# => {"query":{"query_string":{"query":"(name:Steve AND age:<70) OR name:Jo*"}}}

# BlockStack::Query will automatically cast the query based on the adapter send to it
# and then execute the query and return the results.
require 'sequel'
DB = Sequel.sqlite('test.db')

query.execute(DB[:people])

# You can even use it to query arrays of Ruby objects or hashes!
ary = [{ name: 'Jackson', age: 5 }, { name: 'Nehra', age: 2 }, { name: 'Armani', age: 13 }]
p 'age is greater than 4'.to_query.execute(ary)
# => [{:name=>"Jackson", :age=>5}, {:name=>"Armani", :age=>13}]
```
